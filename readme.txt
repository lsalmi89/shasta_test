Combining GPS and strong motion time series

Diego Melgar, 01/2013

This repository  contains two main m-files, kalmand() is a simple forward Kalman filter and kalmans() is a forward filter plus a smoother. Just download the files into your matlab path.

For information on the inner workings of the filter or if you use the algorithm please reference:
